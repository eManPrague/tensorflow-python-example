# Simple example of Convolutional Neural Network, built by Tensorflow, with custom dataset
Convolutional Neural Network are current state of the art for image classification. Let's look how we can build one. üëç You can find here examples of `high level` and `low level` Tensorflow implementations.

The Convolutional Neural Network recognizes a dug toy from our custom dataset. Yes, you can change dataset and train your own CNN.

## You'll find here
- How to define Tensorflow graph
- How to train the network with custom dataset
- How to freeze the model to `.tflite`

## Network Architecture
